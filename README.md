# rippy - create an instant Point-of-Sale app powered by Solana Pay

We believe Solana Pay has the ability to drive significant adoption to Solana and change the course for many merchants. We believe in open-source software and will be updating and maintaining this codebase with new features. We believe merchants should be able to choose an open-source alternative when considering a Solana Pay point-of-sale.

The app is simple to use and is based on the Solana Pay specification which is implemented by all your familiar wallet apps that customers are likely to use. Learn more about Solana Pay here https://solanapay.com
